Spotify's queue implementation:

The queue has two parts:
1. Immediate queue
    When the user queues a track, it is added here
2. Playlist queue
    When the user plays a playlist, then the next and previous tracks
    are stored on this queue

On the event of a playlist insertion or deletion:
    Universal playlist pointer updates to ensure that it still points to the currently playing track,
    deletes the deleted track from the universal playlist too.
On the event of a next instruction:
    Checks to see if the Immediate queue is empty, if it is, then it will just take from the playlist queue,
    If the Immediate queue is not empty, it will play from that, and as soon as it is played, that song is removed
    from immediate queue and is never able to be reached through either back or forward.
On the event of a back instruction:
    Just takes from the playlist queue, ignores immediate queue history as tracks are deleted immediately on play.
